# Monofarbe
Monofarbe is an applicaition which lets users swithch to Monochrome in Android

System switches to Grey Scale when the battery hits 'LOW' level. The 'LOW' level is defined by the OEM (usually 15%). This mode is disabled when the battery reaches the OKAY level (usually 30%) as defined by the OEM.
                This application works on system battery intent and does not poll the battery status continuously. 
                Hence it does not consume battery.
                Phones with LCD screens will not see any advantage as LDC screens consume same amount of power
                at full color or black and white. So this mode is more of fun!
                Phones with AMOLED screens will save some juice as AMOLED displays switch of pixels for deep blacks
